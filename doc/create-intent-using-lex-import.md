6.	Click on the bot you just build.
7.	Click on build.
8.	The build process takes approximately a minute. Once complete, you can ask your bot a question as a way to test it. For example, you could type “what is my checking balance?” in the chat window. At this stage since we have not added in the backend Lambda function, the response will be that the bot is ready for fulfillment.

9.	Then go to Section 3 Create a Lambda function to continue.
